# Flight-Status-Prediction-Project
[Airline On-Time Arrivals]
Use the US Dept. of Transportation on-time arrival data for non-stop domestic flights by major air carriers to predict arrival delays.

Build a binary classification model for predicting arrival delays or a regression model that predicts the extent of the delay.  Do not use departure delay as an input feature.
